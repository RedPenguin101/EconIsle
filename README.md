# EconIsle

This is an unfinished economics simulation game. I don't really recommend anyone download this in its current state, but it does run fine (recommend using cider and "cider-jack-in-clj&cljs to start)

I will likely rewrite it from scratch if this prototype is ever developed into a more complete program. The most interesting thing to look at is probably `engine.clj` which contains the full economics simulation.

## Setup

To get an interactive development environment run:

    clojure -m figwheel.main -b dev -r
